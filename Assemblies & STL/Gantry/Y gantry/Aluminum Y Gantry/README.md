Design Credit of the aluminum bracket: Diemex 

Notes:
  
  - (Screen shot below are from 
  
  -Left side has a X limit switch stopper.
  
  -The back spacer is rotated 180degree from left to right gantry so it helps with belt clearance
  
  # Important:
  -Carbon tube are not always precise to 20x20mm. They range from 20 to 21mm. Mesure you CF tube in height. If your tube is 20mm tall, then you will need to print 4 spacers (2 on each side) of 0.5mm. The Y gantry has an opening of 21mm, so you will need to compensate for 1mm if your tube is 20mm. So 2x0.5mm spacers between Y gantry and tube. (One top and one bottom to keep it centered). If your tube is 20.5mm, then you have a 0.5mm to compensate, so print spacers with 0.25mm height (scale them in Z in your your slicer to the desired height).
  
  -If you use a 20mm profile OR the F3D aluminum tube, you will need to print 4 spacers of 0.5mm and place between the tube and Y aluminum gantry. One on top of the tube, one at the bottom of the tube, sandwiched between Y aluminum gantry and the aluminum tube
