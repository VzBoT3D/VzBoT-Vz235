This is use to connect the CPAP tube. It also acts as a cable holder for the printhead. It will only work with the AWD setup as the 2WD has the belts closer to the rear extrusion profile.

NOTE: You only need a 15.2mm hole in the back pannel. If you prefer the look with the added "CAP" then the hole needs to be 18.2mm. Cap is optional.
